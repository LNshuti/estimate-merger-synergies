**3. Strategic Recommendations**
---------------------------------
**3.1 Short-term value maximization:**

**a) Cost Synergies:** Post-acquisition, UBS should focus on achieving cost synergies by consolidating overlapping operations, eliminating duplicate positions, and streamlining processes. This will help UBS realize substantial cost savings, which can be used to improve operational efficiency and strengthen its competitive position.

**b) Debt Management:** UBS should carefully assess Credit Suisse's debt structure and identify opportunities to reduce debt-related costs. This may include refinancing high-interest debt, negotiating better terms, or restructuring debt to optimize the balance sheet.

**c) Divestiture of Non-core Assets:** UBS should consider divesting non-core assets and business units that do not align with the combined company's strategic objectives. This will generate cash and help UBS focus on its core competencies and growth areas.

**3.2 Long-term value maximization:**

**a) Strengthening Wealth Management:** The combined entity will have a significantly larger client base, enabling UBS to strengthen its Wealth Management business. UBS should focus on enhancing its product offerings, advisory services, and digital platforms to attract and retain high-net-worth clients.

**b) Expansion of Investment Banking and Asset Management:** The acquisition will provide UBS with a broader range of expertise and resources in these areas. UBS should leverage this advantage to expand its investment banking and asset management services, targeting new markets and industry sectors.

**c) Innovation and Digital Transformation:** UBS should continue to invest in innovation and digital transformation initiatives to stay competitive in an increasingly technology-driven financial services landscape. This includes enhancing its digital banking platforms, adopting artificial intelligence and machine learning tools, and exploring new growth areas like blockchain and fintech.

**Conclusion**
---------------
The acquisition of Credit Suisse presents UBS with a significant opportunity to maximize shareholder value in the short and long term. UBS can strengthen its financial position by focusing on cost synergies, debt management, and divestiture of non-core assets in the short term. In the long term, UBS should capitalize on the expanded client base and resources to further develop its core business segments, particularly in wealth management, investment banking, and asset management. Additionally, embracing innovation and digital transformation initiatives will ensure UBS remains competitive in the evolving financial services landscape.

We recommend UBS to move forward with the acquisition, keeping in mind the strategic recommendations outlined in this report.
